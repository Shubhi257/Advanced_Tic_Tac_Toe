#This is the Advanced Version of Tic Tac Toe.

Hello everyone,
I have created a advanced version of Tic Tac Toe,  where the game board size and winning condition can be customized by simply updating the values in the App.js file.

For example, in a 5Ã—5 board, a player can win by placing 4 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
To customize this, you just need to modify the size and marksToWin props like this:

<TicTacToe size={5} marksToWin={4} />

This flexibility allows you to easily change the game's complexity and rules.
Below are some screenshots for better understanding of how the gameplay looks with different configurations:
